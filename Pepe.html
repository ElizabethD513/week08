        <p>The first time I saw the kittens, they were coming out of a dumpster, running away as my car pulled in to my coworker's driveway. Although my coworker fed them everyday, it was nowhere near as much as 
            the whole family needed. She doesn't even like cats but she loved her Dad so she carried on her deceased father's daily ritual of feeding the feral cats that live nearby.  I'm grateful that she took care of
            what turned out to be the nicest group of cats I'd ever met.</p>

        <p>Because of how hungry the cats were, trapping them was surprisingly easy. I set a trap with food inside, and one by one, I caught cat after cat. When I had all the cats in my possession 
            (3 kittens, 4 older kitties from a previous litter, and the mother) I was both socializing and finding homes for them. Since they were such a close family, I wanted to keep them 
            in pairs at the very least.
            One of the homes for the kittens fell through, and while I was keeping them with their mother I became attached to the sweetest little kitten who would be named Pepe. 
            He would flop over onto his belly to let me pet him, and he was my first ever lapcat! As for the other cats, all except one kitten went to homes in pairs,
             except the mother who was taken in along with her two daughters by the best friend you could ask for and the best part - I can see them anytime!</p>
