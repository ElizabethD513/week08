    <p>Let me tell you about the three joys of my life, my three cats. My oldest cat is Mylie, an abyssinian tortie who is about 17 years old. I adopted her from a local shelter where she was highly stressed out. She is feisty, 
        can be sweet, and is highly food motivated. She has always preferred to be the only pet and for many years I kept it that way until I rescued a family of 
		semi feral cats living under my coworker's house. I found homes for each one but I decided the last two kittens had to stay together. I completely fell in love with one particular 
        fluff ball, who I named Pepe after my grandfather, which is very strange but the only name that embodied how sweet and wonderful he was. I kept him and his playful, cute little brother, Ichi- who I also fell in love with. Pepe is all black(with red highlights)
        and Ichi is all black with a white dot on his chest. Mylie is now living in acceptance of Pepe and Ichi although she will hiss and swat if they get too close.</p>
